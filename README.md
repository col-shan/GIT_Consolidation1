# Card Memory Game

Welcome to Colin's Card Memorization Game! This Python program is a simple card memorization game that has 5 rounds. In each round, the player will be shown 4 random cards from a shuffled deck, one at a time, for 2 and a half seconds each. The player will then be prompted to randomly recall either the suits or ranks of the cards. One point is awarded for every correct guess, up to a maximum of 4 points per round and 20 points at the end of the game. The player's score will then be kept in a separate text file and the highest score in said file will be displayed to the player.

## Installation

All you need is Python installed to run this game through your terminal (Mac and Windows friendly)!

## Contributors

I received no help on my code from anyone, but Professor Jackson was used as a resource to bounce ideas off of. Stack Overflow was frequently referred to for helping me better understand the nuances of features I was trying to implement. ChatGPT was used as well for syntax issues I had with my code.
