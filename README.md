# Card Memory Game

Welcome to Colin's Card Memorization Game! This Python program is a simple card memorization game that has 5 rounds. In each round, the player will be shown 4 random cards from a shuffled deck, one at a time, for 2 and a half seconds each. The player will then be prompted to randomly recall either the suits or ranks of the cards. One point is awarded for every correct guess, up to a maximum of 4 points per round and 20 points at the end of the game. The player's score will then be kept in a separate text file, and all of the scores ever received in the game will be displayed in a plot graph. 

## Installation

A potential player needs Python (and the accompanying os, random, and time modules that come with it), the matplotlib module, and my deck module (which can be found via Github) installed to run this game through your terminal (Mac and Windows friendly)!

## Contributors

Lita O'Brien aided me when I was attempting to randomize how the dealer dealt from my deck of cards, and Chris Castillo helped me to create the display_high_score function that reads out the highest existing input from my high_score text file. Stack Overflow was frequently referred to for helping me better understand the nuances of features I was trying to implement. ChatGPT was used as well for syntax issues I had with my code.
