# Colin's Card Memory Game

I have created a memorization game in python using a deck of playing cards as my medium. The deck of cards 

#each card in my deck will contain the typical suits and ranks values
#the dealer will flip 4 cards at a time, with each one displayed for only 2 seconds
#the player will score or lose points by remembering specific aspects (ranks or suits) of cards that they were shown
#there will be 5 rounds
