# Card Memory Game

Welcome to Colin's Card Memorization Game! This Python program is a simple card memorization game that has 5 rounds. In each round, the player will be shown 4 random cards from a shuffled deck, one at a time, for 2 and a half seconds each. The player will then be prompted to randomly recall either the suits or ranks of the cards. One point is awarded for every correct guess, up to a maximum of 4 points per round and 20 points at the end of the game. The player's score will then be kept in a separate text file.

## Installation

All you need is Python installed to run this game!
